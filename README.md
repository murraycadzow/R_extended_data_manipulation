## Setup

**Download the repository**, either:
- By clicking on the green code box in the right corner
- If you have the `use_this` package installed this can be done from within R using
```
usethis::use_course(url = "https://github.com/murraycadzow/R_extended_data_manipulation/archive/master.zip", 
    destdir = "~/Desktop")
```

After opening the R Project, make sure to run this code beforehand to make sure you are all set up.

```{r prerequsites, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# RUN THE FOLLOWING TO SET UP REQUIRED PACKAGES AND DATA
# BEFORE FIRST COMPILING THIS RMD
# (only need to do once)
source("Code/setup.R")
```
